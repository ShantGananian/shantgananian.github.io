<div display= "block" Style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; margin: 0 0 50px;" ><p>In this section, I explore ideas from literature, philosophy, and history — not as academic studies, but as living conversations about our world today. Each essay begins with a book and extends into questions of how we think, create, and live as human beings in an age of rapid change.</p></div>
