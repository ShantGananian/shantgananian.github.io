title: "Between Progress and Restlessness:"
subtitle: "Artificial Intelligence and the Search for the Human"
excerpt: "The rise of AI promises progress — yet stirs a quiet unease. Driven by a self-perpetuating imperative to maximize efficiency and productivity, technology advances without reflection, threatening to standardize the human spirit itself. Where lies the path to resist its dehumanizing effects and preserve freedom?"

In January 2025, a letter from **OpenAI**, the creators of **ChatGPT**, addressing **Stargate**—a **$500 billion artificial intelligence infrastructure project** deemed necessary to enable **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**—stated:

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“All of us look forward to continuing to build and develop AI… for the benefit of all of humanity. We believe that this new step is critical on the path, and will enable creative people to figure out how to use AI to elevate humanity.”</p>
<cite>OpenAI, Announcing the Stargate Project</cite></blockquote>

With this, **artificial intelligence** today is no longer merely the subject of theoretical speculation; it has moved to a **plausible mid-term objective**.

But **should we be worried?** The question seems simple, but it touches on the **core of our times**.

**Demis Hassabis**, a **2024 Nobel laureate** and CEO and co-founder of **Google DeepMind**, when asked in an interview *“What keeps you up at night?”*, replied:

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“For me, it's this question of international standards and cooperation—not just between countries, but also between companies and researchers as we get towards the final steps of AGI. And I think we're on the cusp of that. Maybe we're five to ten years out. Some people say shorter... But either way, it's coming very soon. And I'm not sure society's quite ready for that yet.”&nbsp;</p>
<cite>Demis Hassabis, interview with Time magazine correspondent Billy Perrigo</cite></blockquote>

Being two distinct concepts in the field of **artificial intelligence**, **Generative AI (GenAI)** and **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** differ primarily in their **scope, capabilities, and stage of development**.

While **GenAI** is a **current technology** focused on creating new content by recognizing learned patterns, **AGI** represents a **hypothetical stage** in which a system can **match or exceed human cognitive abilities** in any task—including novel, unfamiliar ones—without retraining, and is capable of **true creativity**.

The **dreams of AI enthusiasts**, like all technology, carry the potential for both **good and harm**. Many scientists, though they agree that this development would **fundamentally transform society**, remain uncertain about the choices they face in this **race between countries and companies**—a race driven by **incentives for profit and power**; between **the risk of AGI spiraling out of control and the risk of falling behind**; between **building too fast** and **not building fast enough**.

**Dario Amodei**, co-founder and CEO of **Anthropic** and a leading AI researcher, posed a haunting thought experiment in an interview with The Economist’s editor-in-chief, Zanny Minton Beddoes: 


<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“If someone dropped a new country into the world—ten million people smarter than any human alive today—you know, you'd ask the question, 'What is their intent? What are they actually going to do in the world, particularly if they're able to act autonomously?'”&nbsp;</p>

## The Mirror of Decadence

Today’s **Generative AI**, though still relatively new, is already being used to **spread misinformation** through AI-generated websites, newsbots, and chatbots.

It is also threatening the **livelihoods of creative workers** across various domains: music composed entirely from scratch by AI, short hypnotic videos designed for engagement, and an influx of AI-generated books, images, and articles.

**New artists are losing the opportunities** once provided by institutions that invested **time, money, and energy** into discovering and developing human talent.

Existing **regulations** govern the **development and deployment** of artificial intelligence, but they do not adequately address its **impact on our cognitive, social, and emotional lives**.

To understand many of the paradoxes in AI’s development, **Jacques Barzun’s** observation of a **decadent era**, which he used to describe Western culture at the end of the 20th century, may provide a useful framework:


<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“It implies in those who live in such a time no loss of energy or talent or moral sense. On the contrary, it is a very active time, full of deep concerns, but peculiarly restless, for it sees no clear lines of advance. The forms of art as life seem exhausted; the stages of development have been run through. Institutions function painfully. Repetition and frustration are the intolerable result. Boredom and fatigue are the great historical forces.”&nbsp;</p>
<cite>Jacques Barzun, From Dawn to Decadence (2000)</cite></blockquote>

Much like Barzun’s decadent societies, the modern race toward **AGI** is marked by **intense**, **almost feverish production**—aimed less at achieving new capabilities than at **maximizing efficiency and reducing cost**. The result: a culture of **“more of the same”** characterized by **perpetual hype** and **iteration**, rather than patient, foundational research.

This relentless momentum creates a **restless atmosphere**, as humans search for **meaning beyond merely building or serving the technology**. The obsession with the **next great leap** is driven by **technological possibility**, not by a **clear vision** of how it will serve humanity.

And as AI begins to surpass human intelligence in areas such as **creativity** and **problem-solving**, the human version of these qualities feels **diminished**—awakening a sense of **boredom** that compels us to confront **existential questions** for which we have no answers, and leaving us in a state of **quiet restlessness**.

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 1em 0;">
    <figure style="display: inline-block; width: 100%; max-width: 500px; margin: 0;">
        <a href="/assets/img/Between Progress and Restlessness/Automat-edward-hopper-1927.png" class="image-popup" title="Edward Hopper, “Automat” (1927). A portrait of solitude and silent restlessness in the modern age.">

        <figcaption style="text-align: left; font-size: 65%; font-style: normal; margin-top: 0.2em;">

It is a state of **existential uneasiness and anxiety**—a feeling of becoming, as **T. S. Eliot** put it, *“hollow men”*:

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p style="margin: 0;">“Shape without form, shade without colour,<br>
Paralysed force, gesture without motion.”</p></blockquote>

And as human relevance is slowly eclipsed by **machine efficiency**, the world itself seems to fade:

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“This is the way the world ends—<br>
Not with a bang but a whimper.”&nbsp;</p>
<cite>T. S. Eliot, “The Hollow Men”</cite></blockquote>

Yet even as the spirit of our modern society slowly erodes, its **structures of power** may endure for a long time—sustaining an **outward show of strength** while **hollowing out within**.

Like the **Roman Empire** in its later centuries, our civilization may be entering a phase of **drawn-out decline**: stable on the surface, but sustained more by **inertia than vitality**.

The poet **W. H. Auden**, in his 1952 review of **Eleanor Clark’s** *Rome and a Villa*, saw in ancient Rome a haunting reflection of our own world:


<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“…the Roman Empire is like a mirror in which we see reflected the brutal, vulgar, powerful yet despairing image of our technological civilization. What fascinates and terrifies us about the Roman Empire is not that it finally went smash, but that it managed to last for four centuries without creativity, warmth, or hope.”&nbsp;</p>
<cite>W. H. Auden, review of Rome and a Villa (1952)</cite></blockquote>

## Restlessness and Renewal

Although the most obvious and direct **harm of AI** is **economic**, its **disruptive effects** will transform our lives in ways we cannot yet understand—**for better or for worse**.

In times of **rapid technological and social acceleration**, the idea of **inner orientation** becomes essential. It is not a matter of **intellect or knowledge**, but about an **inner compass** — the ability to **discern what truly matters** and to find direction amid **abundance and distraction**.

Without it, progress risks becoming **movement without meaning**, **innovation without insight**, and we, **restless amid achievement**, lose our **sense of purpose**.

Yet, the **anxiety and restlessness** we feel may still become a **force for renewal**—if we turn our focus once more to the **human half of the equation**, by a **collective shift** in the **mindset**, **values**, and **psychological outlook** of individuals, through **conscious choices** that cultivate **wisdom, ethical reasoning, and empathy**.

As AI becomes an **autonomous, deterministic force** shaping every aspect of human life, **Jacques Ellul’s** observation gains new relevance:

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p style="margin: 0;">“The first step in the quest, the first act of freedom, is to become aware of the [technological] necessity”</p></blockquote>

A force through which AI, by its own internal logic, shapes our **thinking**, **values**, and **way of life**, often without our awareness. **True freedom**, then, begins with **awareness** — with the **courage to see the constraints of our time clearly** and to **act responsibly within them**, reintroducing a **conscious, human element** into a world that is becoming increasingly **automated and dehumanized**.

In the end, this movement toward inner awareness represents perhaps the most meaningful response we can offer — a form of **self-governed action**, a **higher degree of freedom** that **generates change from within**. It leads, finally, to what **Carl Jung** described as the **achievement of personality**:

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Such problems are never solved by legislation or by tricks. They are solved only by a general change of attitude. And the change does not begin with propaganda and mass meetings, or with violence. It begins with a change in individuals. It will continue as a transformation of their personal likes and dislikes, of their outlook on life and of their values, and only the accumulation of these individual changes will produce a collective solution.”&nbsp;</p>
<cite>Carl Jung, Psychology and Religion (1938)</cite></blockquote>
