## So, who am I?

My name is Shant Gananian. Mechanical engineer, enthusiast for smart micro-mechatronic systems. I recently completed my second degree and earned a master's degree in mechanical engineering majoring in mechatronics and microsystems technology and minoring in robotics and medical engineering at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://www.kit.edu/) in Germany. A course of study that I felt was best suited to prepare me for future challenges, given the increasing global integration of mechanical, electronic, computational and control systems by expanding my knowledge and skills in the fascinating fields of automation, robotics and microsystems engineering that I have grown to love over the years.

During my study I have participated in [COSIMA](https://www.elektronikforschung.de/foerderung/nachwuchsfoerderung/cosima) competition for students with ideas and inventions about microsystems. Our team of four, named [POCED](https://teampoced.wixsite.com/poced), developed and built affordable microfluidic point-of-care-testing (POCT) system to help patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to monitor the progression of the disease from home. We were awarded with the [first prize](https://www.cosima-mems.de/de/preistraeger/sieger-2019).

At KIT's [Institute for Automation and Applied Computer Science (IAI)](https://www.iai.kit.edu/index.php) and to enhance my academic profile I worked as research assistant, both during my studies as well as for a year after graduation, in the field of mechatronics and automation technology.

With good leadership skills, programming knowledge, in-depth knowledge of the product development process and experience in finding creative solutions to complex technical problems, I have a proven track record of producing and improving products, methods and manufacturing processes.

After completing my first degree; diploma in Mechanical engineering, majoring in Power Engineering, I built a successful career, 9+ years, in promoting and implementing management systems for production, quality, sustainability and safety, by holding highly responsible positions; Production Manager followed by (quality, health, safety and environment) QHSE Manager positions, in large corporate groups in various industries in the United Arab Emirates.

## My work philosophy

My work philosophy is integrated into of my way of life. That is, concentrating at every moment, insofar as I am able, firmly resolved, on accomplishing the work at hand with fitting and genuine seriousness, love for others, willingly, with justice, and on banishing from my thoughts all other distractions.

Being part of nature, I identify myself not only with my own immediate family, but with the broader rational community and environment, including the work environment, where I strive to contribute to the happiness and flourishing of humanity through duties (rational acts) performed with right disposition (correct understanding). In other words, contributing through virtuous acts that render me just (honest, fair), temperate (disciplined), courageous (industrious and endurant in the face of difficulties) and free (independent).

Each day is a new chance for me to grow by taking ownership of my day, overcoming my shortcomings through self-reflection, careful judgements, training and applying. This struggle toward fulfilling my rightful duties by trying my utmost under the circumstances, is enough to fill my heart with happiness.

## Why did I build this website?

After obtaining my masterâ€™s degree, and to provide potential employers greater value through my skills, I dedicated months building upon my knowledge and training at the university and further developing my skills in computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided engineering (CAE) for simulation and analysis, and program development for analyzing simple to complex systems through researching and implementing many hands-on projects and typical technical problems. To share all that, I decided to build this portfolio website.

Building this website was a challenging task for me, which I accomplished successfully, without any previous experience in this area. To do this, I had to learn, among other things, the basics of web design and HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Markdown and Liquid programming languages.

I hope that the information on this website could be helpful to those who are interested in the subjects and that it can be a bridge to communicate some details about me and my skills.
