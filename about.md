## So, Who Am I?

My name is **Shant Gananian**—a mechanical engineer with a strong passion for smart micro-mechatronic systems and a deep curiosity for innovation at the intersection of mechanics, electronics, and computing.

I recently completed my second degree: a **Master’s in Mechanical Engineering** from the **[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://www.kit.edu/){:target="_blank"}** in Germany, majoring in **Mechatronics and Microsystems Technology** with minors in **Robotics** and **Medical Engineering**. This course of study was the natural next step in preparing for the future of engineering—where automation, robotics, and integrated systems play a central role.

<a id="subsection-a"></a>
### Academic and Research Experience

To strengthen my academic path, I worked at KIT’s **[Institute for Automation and Applied Computer Science (IAI)](https://www.iai.kit.edu/index.php){:target="_blank"}** both during and after my studies. There, I contributed to research in the **identification, control, and monitoring of multi-size systems**, as well as the **application of automation in the circular economy**.

For my **Master’s thesis**, I explored new materials and methods for **solution-based encapsulation of printed electronic devices**.

I:
<ul>
  <li>Designed and modified a <strong>Water Vapour Transmission Rate (WVTR) test</strong>,</li>
  <li>Developed encapsulation membranes using <strong>Polyvinylalcohol (PVA)</strong> and five different <strong>nanofillers</strong> (clays, silica, graphene oxide, and glass flakes),</li>
  <li>Tested them on printed electronic structures,</li>
  <li>And co-authored a paper presented at the <a href="https://2024.ieee-fleps.org/" target="_blank"><strong>IEEE FLEPS 2024 Conference</strong></a> in Tampere, Finland (more on this under <a href="#Publications">Publications</a>).</li>
</ul>

### Industry Background

Before pursuing my Master’s, I earned my **first degree (Diploma)** in Mechanical Engineering, majoring in **Power Engineering**, and spent over **nine years** in the United Arab Emirates. I held **senior leadership roles** including **Production Manager** and **QHSE Manager** across large industrial groups.

In these roles, I led initiatives to implement and optimize systems for production, quality, safety, and sustainability—delivering measurable improvements in operational efficiency and compliance.

I bring together:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Leadership experience</strong>,</li>
  <li><strong>Technical problem-solving skills</strong>,</li>
  <li>A hands-on understanding of <strong>product development</strong>, and</li>
  <li>A strong foundation in <strong>software and programming</strong> for engineering solutions.</li>
</ul>

<a id="subsection-c"></a>
### Project Highlights

Throughout my studies, I actively pursued hands-on learning and research opportunities. Some key projects include:

<a id="subsubsection-a"></a>
#### <a href="https://www.elektronikforschung.de/foerderung/nachwuchsfoerderung/cosima" target="_blank">COSIMA</a> Student Competition – <a href="https://www.cosima-mems.de/de/preistraeger/sieger-2019#:~:text=1.-,Preis,-Team%20Poced" target="_blank">1st Place Award</a>

With a <a href="/assets/pdf/about/team-poced-beschreibung-data.pdf" target="_blank">team of four</a>, I developed a **low-cost microfluidic point-of-care testing (POCT) device** for at-home monitoring of **chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)** patients.

This was conceptualized during the “Hands-on BioMEMS” seminar and later realized at KIT’s **[Institute of Microstructure Technology (IMT)](https://www.imt.kit.edu/index.php){:target="_blank"}**.

#### Internship – [Humanoid Robotics](https://h2t.iar.kit.edu/28_1709.php){:target="_blank"} (KIT [IAR](https://www.informatik.kit.edu/english/5107.php){:target="_blank"})

Our team programmed **Armar-6**, a humanoid robot, using **C++** and the **ArmarX** framework. The robot was trained to:
<ul>
  <li>Navigate autonomously in a factory setting,</li>
  <li>Avoid collisions,</li>
  <li>Grasp and assemble parts correctly using motion planning and visual servoing.</li>
</ul>

#### Internship – [Microfabrication project: Development and production of a microsystem](https://www.wbk.kit.edu/lehrveranstaltungen_2058.php)

At KIT’s **[wbk Institute of Production Engineering](https://www.wbk.kit.edu/english/index.php){:target="_blank"}**, and in collaboration with **[ROSSWAG Engineering](https://rosswag-engineering.de){:target="_blank"}**, we developed and implemented a concept to improve the efficiency of a generatively manufactured **impeller**. The approach involved **boundary layer control** using **micro-blowout channels** to reduce surface resistance, and was realized within the scope of a microfabrication project, involving:
<ul>
  <li>Combination of <strong>Selective Laser Melting (SLM)</strong> and <strong>micro-milling</strong>,</li>
  <li>Micro-blowout channels for flow stabilization,</li>
  <li>Objective: <strong>friction reduction, cooling, and self-cleaning</strong>.</li>
</ul>

## Current Role

I currently work as a **Mechatronics Engineer** in the **Quality Management and Assurance (QMS)** department at KIT, within the **Project, Process, and Quality Management (PPQ)** service unit.
My role focuses on **quality assurance and technical support** for **large-scale, interdisciplinary investment projects** (each exceeding €2.5 million). I support these projects throughout all major phases:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Initiation Phase:</strong> Helping define quality requirements and ensuring compliance with relevant standards, laws, and regulations.</li>
  <li><strong>Planning Phase:</strong> Assisting in the specification of technical and quality requirements, and supporting procurement documents.</li>
  <li><strong>Execution Phase:</strong> Overseeing implementation through supplier audits, design reviews, and factory/site acceptance testing (FAT/SAT).</li>
  <li><strong>Final Phase:</strong> Ensuring comprehensive technical documentation and supporting commissioning.</li>
</ul>

Through this role, I work closely with engineering, procurement, and compliance teams, bridging disciplines to ensure technically sound and quality-driven project execution.

<a id="section-c"></a>
## My Work Philosophy

I approach my work as an extension of how I live: with focus, care, and ethical responsibility. I strive to:
<ul>
   <li>Stay present and purposeful in every task,</li>
   <li>Act fairly and with integrity,</li>
   <li>Maintain discipline in my craft, and</li>
   <li>Embrace challenges with endurance and adaptability.</li>
</ul>

I see myself as part of a broader community—local and global—and try to contribute through meaningful, reasoned actions that serve others and build a better future. Growth, for me, is a daily pursuit of self-improvement, learning, and putting knowledge into practice.

<a id="section-d"></a>
## Why I Built This Website

After completing my studies, I wanted to consolidate and showcase the work I’ve done across disciplines and domains. I dedicated months to deepening my knowledge in **CAD, CAE**, and programming by tackling complex technical problems and personal projects.

To bring it all together, I built this website from scratch—teaching myself **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Markdown**, and **Liquid** along the way. It was a challenging but rewarding project that helped me grow beyond my comfort zone.

My hope is that this site can serve as a bridge:
<ul>
  <li>For employers and collaborators to learn more about me and my capabilities,</li>
  <li>And for fellow learners to find insights or inspiration through the projects I’ve shared.</li>
</ul>
