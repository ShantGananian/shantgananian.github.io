## So, who am I?

My name is Shant Gananian. Mechanical engineer, enthusiast for smart micro-mechatronic systems. I recently completed my second degree and earned a master's degree in mechanical engineering majoring in mechatronics and microsystems technology and minoring in robotics and medical engineering at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://www.kit.edu/) in Germany. A course of study that I felt was best suited to prepare me for future challenges, given the increasing global integration of mechanical, electronic, computational and control systems by expanding my knowledge and skills in the fascinating fields of automation, robotics and microsystems engineering that I have grown to love over the years.

To expand my academic career, I worked at the [Institute for Automation and Applied Computer Science (IAI)](https://www.iai.kit.edu/index.php) at KIT both during my studies and for a year after graduation as a research assistant in the field of identification, control and monitoring of multi-size systems and the application of automation technology for the circular economy.

At this institute I did my Master's thesis where I investigated materials and processes for solution based encapsulation for printed electronic devices. I designed the experiments, developed and modified Water Vapour Transmission Rate (WVTR) test, carried out the experiments in the lab and evaluated the results. I prepared encapsulation membranes with Polyvinylalcohol as a base polymer and with five different nanofiller materials; two type of clays, silica, graphene oxide and glass flakes. I tested these membranes both with my modified WVTR test and by applying these membranes on printed test structures. My results laid the grounds for further research with this type of material system for encapsulation and for a conference publication on this topic for which I am co-author (<a href="https://2024.ieee-fleps.org/" target="_blank">IEEE International Conference on Flexible Printable Sensors and Systems (IEEE FLEPS 2024)</a> in Tampere, Finland).

In the internship about [humanoide robots](https://h2t.iar.kit.edu/28_1709.php), our team's task was to program the KIT [Anthropomatics and Robotics institute (IAR)](https://www.informatik.kit.edu/english/5107.php)'s "Armar 6" robot in C++ and by using the robot development environment Armarx software, to collect several parts of a product, situated in different places in a factory hall, while avoiding any collision, and finally, to assemble the parts together in the correct way, i.e. by putting two gears in their locations in a box and putting the cover above it. Tasks included motion planning (navigation, collision detection and avoidance, grasping, placing) and visual servoing among others.

In internship [Microfabrication project: Development and production of a microsystem](https://www.wbk.kit.edu/lehrveranstaltungen_2058.php) at [wbk Institute of Production Engineering](https://www.wbk.kit.edu/english/index.php) at KIT in a joint project with the industrial partner [ROSSWAG Engineering](https://rosswag-engineering.de), we developed a solution to increase the efficiency of a generatively manufactured impeller through boundary layer control by fabricating the impeller with longitudinal micro channels of $1mm$ diameter through selective laser melting (SLM) and drilling of inner channels of $200 \mu m$ diameter and $45°$ bore angle by means of micro-milling that connect the longitudinal channels to the surface of the blades. Our concept was designing these active micro channels in a way to achieve micro blow-out in the turbulent area on the impeller blades through staggered channels for optimally influencing the boundary layer of the flow. In this way we stabilized the flow above the impeller blades by successfully reducing the surface resistance and achieving cooling and self-cleaning of the channels.

## My work philosophy and ethics

My work philosophy is integrated into of my way of life. That is, concentrating at every moment, insofar as I am able, firmly resolved, on accomplishing the work at hand with fitting and genuine seriousness, love for others, willingly, with justice, and banishing from my thoughts all other distractions.

Being part of nature, I identify myself not only with my own immediate family, but with the broader rational community and environment, including the work environment, where I strive to contribute to the happiness and flourishing of humanity through duties (rational acts) performed with right disposition (correct understanding). In other words, contributing through virtuous acts that render me just (honest, fair), temperate (disciplined), courageous (industrious and endurant in the face of difficulties) and free (independent).

Each day is a new chance for me to grow by taking ownership of my day, overcoming my shortcomings through self-reflection, careful judgements, training and applying. This struggle toward fulfilling my rightful duties by trying my utmost under the circumstances, is enough to fill my heart with happiness.

## Why did I build this website?

After obtaining my master’s degree, and to provide potential employers greater value through my skills, I dedicated months building upon my knowledge and training at the university and further developing my skills in computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided engineering (CAE) for simulation and analysis, and program development for analyzing simple to complex systems through researching and implementing many hands-on projects and typical technical problems. To share all that, I decided to build this portfolio website.

Building this website was a challenging task for me, which I accomplished successfully, without any previous experience in this area. To do this, I had to learn, among other things, the basics of web design and HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Markdown and Liquid programming languages.

I hope that the information on this website could be helpful to those who are interested in the subjects and that it can be a bridge to communicate some details about me and my skills.
